    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Arepa is a type of flatbread made of ground maize dough stuffed with a filling, eaten in northern parts of South America since pre-Columbian times, and notable primarily in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela, but also present in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Central America.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough. </li>
            <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket. </li>
            <li>Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
